        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 1%">
          As a software development student, a lot of people think that i nearly
          have no free time (which is kinda true), but i somehow manage to do a
          lot of things in my free time. <br />

          <h3>Music Production</h3>
          <p>
            The process of creating music, something that has never been there
            before, is one of the, in my opinion, most beautiful things in the
            world. <br />
            It requires a reasonable amount of time to be able to produce a
            song. Depending on the genre, it can take a little more or less
            time, until the point is reached. <br />
            When i ask people what they think is the hardest part in music
            production, a lot of people think it's the arrangement <br />
            or maybe the mixing of all the different sounds into one big piece,
            but i would say it's definitely the ear you listen with. <br />
            What i mean by that is, you have to know when the mix of the song
            actually sounds good. It requires a lot of time and experience to
            know
            <br />
            how a good mix sounds.

          <h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
          <p>
            Parallel to my studying start, i started playing the guitar. So i've
            been playing since September 2022 <br />
            and i'm making quite good progress so far. I own two electric
            guitars, one acoustic and a ukulele. The one on the image was my
            first electric guitar, it's the Harley Benton TE-62CC. <br />
            The main reason why i started playing guitar was, so that i can add
            something new to my music production workflow. <br />
            This is very useful, since i can connect an electric guitar simply
            to my audio interface, record and use directly the riffs that i play
            on the guitar.

          <h3>Hiking</h3>
          <p>
            Hiking is one of my favorite activities. I love exploring new trails
            and being surrounded by nature. There's something about the
            peacefulness of the outdoors that can't be found anywhere else. I
            find that hiking is not only good exercise, but also a way to clear
            my mind and relieve stress. I always make sure to bring the
            essentials, such as water, snacks, and a first aid kit, just in
            case. I also like to bring a camera to capture the breathtaking
            views along the way. One of my most memorable hikes was in the Austrian 
            Mountains "Lavantthaler Alpen". The towering peaks and crystal-clear lakes were simply
            stunning. It was challenging, but the feeling of accomplishment upon
            reaching the summit was incredible. Hiking is also a great way to
            connect with friends and family. I enjoy sharing the experience with
            others and making memories together. Whether it's a leisurely stroll
            or a strenuous climb, hiking is an activity that anyone can enjoy.
            For me, hiking is more than just a hobby, it's a way of life. It
            reminds me to slow down and appreciate the beauty of the world
            around me.
