        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 1%">
          As a software development student, a lot of people think that i nearly
          have no free time (which is kinda true), but i somehow manage to do a
          lot of things in my free time. <br>

            <h3>Music Production</h3>
            <p>
              The process of creating music, something that has never been there
              before, is one of the, in my opinion, most beautiful things in the
              world. <br>
              It requires a reasonable amount of time to be able to produce a
              song. Depending on the genre, it can take a little more or less
              time, until the point is reached. <br>
              When i ask people what they think is the hardest part in music
              production, a lot of people think it's the arrangement <br>
              or maybe the mixing of all the different sounds into one big
              piece, but i would say it's definitely the ear you listen with.
              <br>
              What i mean by that is, you have to know when the mix of the song
              actually sounds good. It requires a lot of time and experience to
              know
              <br>
              how a good mix sounds.

            <h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
            <p>
              Since starting my studies, I've also picked up the guitar and have
              been making good progress since September 2022. I own two electric
              guitars, two acoustic guitar, a bass and a ukulele, but the Harley
              Benton TE-62CC pictured here was my first electric guitar. <br>I
              decided to learn to play guitar as a way to add something new to
              my music production workflow, which has been incredibly useful.
              With a simple connection to my audio interface, I can now record
              and use riffs that I play on the guitar directly in my music
              production. It's been a fun and rewarding journey so far, and I
              look forward to continuing to improve my skills on the guitar.

            <h3>Hiking</h3>
            <p>
              Hiking is one of my favorite activities. I love exploring new
              trails and being surrounded by nature. There's something about the
              peacefulness of the outdoors that can't be found anywhere else. I
              find that hiking is not only good exercise, but also a way to
              clear my mind and relieve stress. I always make sure to bring the
              essentials, such as water, snacks, and a first aid kit, just in
              case. I also like to bring a camera to capture the breathtaking
              views along the way. One of my most memorable hikes was in the
              Austrian Mountains "Lavantthaler Alpen". The towering peaks and
              crystal-clear lakes were simply stunning. It was challenging, but
              the feeling of accomplishment upon reaching the summit was
              incredible. Hiking is also a great way to connect with friends and
              family. I enjoy sharing the experience with others and making
              memories together. Whether it's a leisurely stroll or a strenuous
              climb, hiking is an activity that anyone can enjoy. For me, hiking
              is more than just a hobby, it's a way of life. It reminds me to
              slow down and appreciate the beauty of the world around me.

            <h3>PC Building</h3>
            <p>
              I love building and repairing PCs! It's a hobby that combines my
              passion for technology with my desire to create something
              tangible. Putting together a computer requires research, planning,
              and patience, but the end result is always worth it. I am an avid
              PC builder and enthusiast, and I take great pride in building and
              customizing my own systems. I love researching the latest hardware
              and technology, and I am always looking for ways to optimize
              performance and push the limits of what's possible. One of my
              proudest accomplishments is the custom water-cooled PC that I
              built from scratch. It took countless hours of planning, research,
              and careful assembly to get it just right, but the end result was
              truly worth it. Seeing my creation come to life and run smoothly
              was an incredible feeling that only a fellow PC enthusiast can
              understand. Whether I'm building a new system for myself or
              helping a friend with their build, I always approach the process
              with enthusiasm and attention to detail. To me, there's nothing
              more satisfying than turning a pile of components into a
              high-performance machine that can handle even the most demanding
              tasks.

            <h3>Traveling</h3>
            <p>
              I love to travel and explore different parts of the world. I find
              it exciting to learn about new cultures, try new foods, and see
              different landscapes. One of my favorite things about traveling is
              meeting new people and making connections with them. I believe
              that traveling helps me grow as a person and become more
              open-minded. I am always looking for new opportunities to travel,
              whether it's within my own country or to far-off destinations.
              It's a way for me to escape my everyday routine and experience
              something new and exciting. My ultimate goal when traveling is to
              have fun and make memories that will last a lifetime. I want to be
              able to look back on my travels and know that I truly experienced
              everything each place had to offer.

            <h3>Vinyl records</h3>
            <p>
              Music has been a passion of mine for a while now. I love exploring
              different genres, discovering new artists, and listening to albums
              from start to finish. For me, music is not just a form of
              entertainment, but a way of life. One of my favorite ways to enjoy
              music is by listening to vinyl records on my Technics SL-1300
              turntable. I started collecting vinyl in December 2021, and I
              already own more than 210 records. There's just something special
              about the warm sound and tactile experience of vinyl that can't be
              replicated by digital formats. I take pride in maintaining my
              turntable and collection, and I love spending hours browsing
              record stores, searching for hidden gems and rare finds. Whether
              I'm playing a classic rock album or exploring a new electronic
              release, the experience of listening to music on my turntable is
              always immersive and engaging. It's a form of escapism that allows
              me to disconnect from the world and fully immerse myself in the
              music. Music is a powerful force that can connect people and
              cultures, and I'm grateful for the role it plays in my life.
