            <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
            <p>As a software development student, a lot of people think that I have nearly no free time (which is kinda true), but I somehow manage to do a lot of things in my free time.</p>

                <h3>Music Production</h3>
                <p>
                    The process of creating music, something that has never been there before, is one of the, in my opinion, most beautiful things in the world.
                    It requires a reasonable amount of time to be able to produce a song. Depending on the genre, it can take a little more or less time, until the point is reached.
                    When I ask people what they think is the hardest part in music production, a lot of people think it's the arrangement or maybe the mixing of all the different sounds into one big piece, 
                    but I would say it's definitely the ear you listen with. What I mean by that is, you have to know when the mix of the song actually sounds good. 
                    It requires a lot of time and experience to know how a good mix sounds.

                <h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
                <p>
                    Since starting my studies, I've also picked up the guitar and have been making good progress since September 2022. 
                    I own two electric guitars, two acoustic guitars, a bass and a ukulele, but the Harley Benton TE-62CC pictured here was my first electric guitar. 
                    I decided to learn to play guitar as a way to add something new to my music production workflow, which has been incredibly useful. 
                    With a simple connection to my audio interface, I can now record and use riffs that I play on the guitar directly in my music production. 
                    It's been a fun and rewarding journey so far, and I look forward to continuing to improve my skills on the guitar.

                <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>
                    Hiking is one of my favorite activities. I love exploring new trails and being surrounded by nature. There's something about the peacefulness of the outdoors 
                    that can't be found anywhere else. I find that hiking is not only good exercise, but also a way to clear my mind and relieve stress. 
                    I always make sure to bring the essentials, such as water, snacks, and a first aid kit, just in case. I also like to bring a camera to capture 
                    the breathtaking views along the way. One of my most memorable hikes was in the Austrian Mountains "Lavantthaler Alpen". 
                    The towering peaks and crystal-clear lakes were simply stunning. It was challenging, but the feeling of accomplishment upon reaching the summit was incredible. 
                    Hiking is also a great way to connect with friends and family. Whether it's a leisurely stroll or a strenuous climb, hiking is an activity that anyone can enjoy. 
                    For me, hiking is more than just a hobby, it's a way of life. It reminds me to slow down and appreciate the beauty of the world around me.

                <h3>PC Building</h3>
                <p>
                    I love building and repairing PCs! It's a hobby that combines my passion for technology with my desire to create something tangible. 
                    Putting together a computer requires research, planning, and patience, but the end result is always worth it. I am an avid PC builder and enthusiast, 
                    and I take great pride in building and customizing my own systems. I love researching the latest hardware and technology, 
                    and I am always looking for ways to optimize performance and push the limits of what's possible. One of my proudest accomplishments is the custom 
                    water-cooled PC that I built from scratch. It took countless hours of planning, research, and careful assembly to get it just right, 
                    but the end result was truly worth it. Seeing my creation come to life and run smoothly was an incredible feeling that only a fellow PC enthusiast can understand. 
                    Whether I'm building a new system for myself or helping a friend with their build, I always approach the process with enthusiasm and attention to detail.

                <h3>Traveling</h3>
                <p>
                    I love to travel and explore different parts of the world. I find it exciting to learn about new cultures, try new foods, and see different landscapes. 
                    One of my favorite things about traveling is meeting new people and making connections with them. I believe that traveling helps me grow as a person 
                    and become more open-minded. I am always looking for new opportunities to travel, whether it's within my own country or to far-off destinations. 
                    It's a way for me to escape my everyday routine and experience something new and exciting. My ultimate goal when traveling is to have fun and make 
                    memories that will last a lifetime. I want to be able to look back on my travels and know that I truly experienced everything each place had to offer.

                <h3>Vinyl Records</h3>
                <p>
                    Music has been a passion of mine for a while now. I love exploring different genres, discovering new artists, and listening to albums from start to finish. 
                    For me, music is not just a form of entertainment, but a way of life. One of my favorite ways to enjoy music is by listening to vinyl records on my 
                    Technics SL-1300 turntable. I started collecting vinyl in December 2021, and I already own more than 210 records. There's just something special about 
                    the warm sound and tactile experience of vinyl that can't be replicated by digital formats. I take pride in maintaining my turntable and collection, 
                    and I love spending hours browsing record stores, searching for hidden gems and rare finds. Whether I'm playing a classic rock album or exploring a new 
                    electronic release, the experience of listening to music on my turntable is always immersive and engaging. It's a form of escapism that allows me to 
                    disconnect from the world and fully immerse myself in the music. Music is a powerful force that can connect people and cultures, 
                    and I'm grateful for the role it plays in my life.
