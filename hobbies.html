      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        As a software development student, a lot of people think that i nearly
        have no free time (which is kinda true), but i somehow manage to do a
        lot of things in my free time. <br />

        <h3>Music Production</h3>
        <p>
          The process of creating music, something that has never been there
          before, is one of the, in my opinion, most beautiful things in the
          world. <br />
          It requires a reasonable amount of time to be able to produce a song.
          Depending on the genre, it can take a little more or less time, until
          the point is reached. <br />
          When i ask people what they think is the hardest part in music
          production, a lot of people think it's the arrangement <br />
          or maybe the mixing of all the different sounds into one big piece,
          but i would say it's definitely the ear you listen with. <br />
          What i mean by that is, you have to know when the mix of the song
          actually sounds good. It requires a lot of time and experience to know
          <br />
          how a good mix sounds.

        <h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
        <p>
          Parallel to my studying start, i started playing the guitar. So i've
          been playing since September 2022 <br />
          and i'm making quite good progress so far. I own two electric guitars, one
          acoustic and a ukulele. The one on the image was my first electric guitar, it's the Harley Benton TE-62CC. <br />
          The main reason why i started playing guitar was, so that i can add
          something new to my music production workflow. <br />
          This is very useful, since i can connect an electric guitar simply to
          my audio interface, record and use directly the riffs that i play on
          the guitar.
