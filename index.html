        <h2>Hello.</h2>

          software, or producing a song, just hit me up!

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            I had my first experiences with HTML & CSS in 2017. In 2018 i had my
            first experience with object oriented programing with C#. <br />But
            i was not consistent with programming. In December 2019 i started
            teaching myself iOS development, <br />
            but this time i did it consistently and i'm really having fun until
            now, learning real programming with different languages. <br />
            I already worked on a few production apps and learned a lot of new
            things from the iOS & frontend world. ðŸ˜Ž <br />
            In the â˜€ summer of 2020 â˜€ i started learning a little bit more
            Web-Development, especially CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, PHP & JS.
            <br />

          <h3>Music Production</h3>
          <p>
            I've been producing music with the professional DAW FL-Studio for
            more than 5 years now. <br />
            Already produced more than 40 tracks in different tempos and genres.
            <br />But i still see myself as a beginner. <br />It is a very long
            learning process, but that's one of the reasons why i love it.
            <br />I already worked with artists like Alllone, d:Enigma,
            Project98 and Savi Kaboo.
