            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
              I began my journey in web development in 2017 with HTML and CSS,
              and in 2018, I delved into object-oriented programming using C#.
              However, my inconsistency hindered my progress in programming. It
              wasn't until December 2019 that I rekindled my passion for
              programming and started teaching myself iOS development. I found
              myself really enjoying learning real programming with different
              languages, and have since worked on several production apps,
              gaining valuable experience and knowledge in the iOS and frontend
              world. In the summer of 2020, I continued expanding my skills by
              diving into web development, including CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap,
              PHP, and JS. After that I worked as an iOS and frontend developer
              from 2021 to 2022. My passion for programming and development has
              led me to pursue further education and I am currently studying
              Mobile Software Development at FH JOANNEUM since September 2022.

            <h3>Music Production</h3>
            <p>
              I've been producing music with the professional DAW FL Studio for
              over 5 years now, and I have already created more than 40 tracks
              in various tempos and genres. Despite my experience, I still
              consider myself a beginner because music production is a
              continuous learning process, and that's one of the reasons why I
              love it. I have had the pleasure of collaborating with artists
              such as Alllone, d:Enigma, Project98, and Savi Kaboo.
