        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a software development student, musician, and athlete, passionate about everything I do. My journey combines technology with creativity, always striving to push boundaries and learn new things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Music plays a central role in my life, both electronically and with traditional instruments. The experience of listening to vinyl records has become almost spiritual for me, connecting technology with artistry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nature and physical activity are essential parts of my lifestyle. I enjoy hiking, spending time outdoors, and staying socially active. My love for animals occasionally leads me to dog walking adventures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professionally, I aim to become a successful mobile software developer while maintaining a balance with my creative pursuits. Travel and cultural exploration are significant aspirations, as I believe they broaden perspectives and inspire innovation.
        </p>
