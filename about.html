      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software development student, musician and athlete, and very
        passionate about the things i do. <br />
        I do sports, make music (electronic and with instruments), love being in
        nature and I'm very socially active. <br />
        My love for animals is also a very big part of my life, so i'm going on
        a regular basis with a dog who needs it for a walk. <br />
        My dream is it to be happy with what i do and to be proud of myself.
        <br />
        My goal is it to travel around the world and see the most interesting
        cultures and people. For my professional life, i'm planing to be a successfull software developer, <br>
        especially in the mobile (native iOS) industry.
