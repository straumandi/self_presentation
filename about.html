          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a software development student, musician, and athlete, and I am
            passionate about everything I do. <br><br>
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid sports enthusiast
            and musician, both electronically and with traditional instruments.
            I love nothing more than losing myself in the sound of a vinyl
            record player, and I find the experience to be almost spiritual.
            <br><br>
            Being in nature is also a favorite pastime, and I am highly socially
            active. Animals are an important part of my life, and I sometimes
            have the opportunity to take a dog for a walk. <br><br>
            My ultimate goal is to be happy and proud of myself, and I am
            constantly striving towards this end. In my professional life, I aim
            to become a successful software developer, with a focus on the
            mobile industry. Along with my
            professional aspirations, I have a strong desire to explore
            different cultures and see the world. I also have an interest in
            spiritualism and find that music, nature, and exploring different
            cultures are all ways to connect with something greater than myself.
